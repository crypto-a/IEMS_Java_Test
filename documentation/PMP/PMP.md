___
## Executive Summary
___
> The project aims to automate the testing process of a website's User Interface (UI) to ensure its quality before deployment on AWS. By collecting data from a CSV file and comparing it with the values displayed on the website, the project will test the UI. The project involves designing, implementing, and testing the code on the company's website, generating a report of passed and failed tests. The project will record and store the test results for future access.  Risks include technical, schedule, resource, budget, external, communication, and data privacy & security. The project requires a Python Developer, access to the company's test website, and necessary development tools. Key stakeholders will receive regular updates through various communication channels. The Quality Management Plan prioritizes functionality and optimization of the code. The Change Management Plan outlines the process for identifying, evaluating, approving/rejecting, implementing, and monitoring changes. Upon project closure, deliverables include a functional testing system and documentation for usage.

## Project Description
___
> The project aims to automate the process of testing the User Interface of a website. we want to ensure the quality of the website before deployed on AWS for clients. The data will be collected as a CSV file alongside with the URL of the website that is being tested. Then the different values shown on the website will be tested and compared to the Given values in the CSV file. The project will involve designing, implementing the code and testing it on the current website witch will be provided by the company! Then a report will be generated showing the passed and failed tests! The tests will also be recorded and saved on a database for future access!

## Change Management Plan
> As the Project is only 8 weeks long, management change is rare. However, the procedure is the as follows:
> ***
>
> 1. **Identify the change:** The first step in the change request process is to identify the change that needs to be made. This can be done by reviewing project documentation, conducting project status meetings, or receiving input from stakeholders.
> ***
>
> 2. **Evaluate the change:** Once the change has been identified, it will be evaluated to determine its impact on the project. This includes assessing the impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources, as well as the impact on project stakeholders.
> ***
>
> 3. **Approve or reject the change:** Based on the evaluation, the change will be approved or rejected. If the change is approved, it will be implemented according to the change management plan. If the change is rejected, the reasons for the rejection will be communicated to the stakeholders.
> ***
>
> 4. **Implement the change:** Once the change has been approved, it will be implemented according to the change management plan. This includes communicating the change to stakeholders, updating project documentation, and training project team members as necessary.
> ***
>
> 5. **Monitor and evaluate the change:** After the change has been implemented, it will be monitored and evaluated to determine its impact on the project. Any issues or problems that arise as a result of the change will be addressed and resolved.

## Closure and Evaluation
> ### Deliverables:
> 1. Functional testing System:
     >   - A fully functional code that can bve used to test values shown in the feeder network for each node in each scenario.
>   - The code should be optimized for performance and scalability, and should be able to handle the expected volume of data!
>   - The software should be able to do tests with, see the results and save them for future access! The results scan also be exported as a PDF or emailed to the programmer!
> ### 
>
> ### 
>
> 2. Design and Implementation Documentation:
     >   - Comments in the Code
>   - ProgramInfo file containing pseudocode and IPO
>   - Readme file that Explains how to use the software
> ###
>
> ***
>
> ### Project Boundaries:
>   - This project only covers the design, development and testing of the testing software. It does not include any changes or updates to the User Interface itself.
>   - The software will only be reporting the weather a test passed or failed and will not include an analysis feature to identify the issues with the website code.
>
> ### Assumptions and Constraints:
>   - The project assumes that the current website code is stable
>   - The project is constrained by a budget of $7600 and a time frame of 8 week.
